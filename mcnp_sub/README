Hi Bill,

The card for producing an MCTAL file is the "prdmp" card (again, case-insensitive).

The arguments are tricky due to MCNP's long-standing syntax "features".  Basically, for any card like this, a user can skip entries and leave the default (without having to explicitly declare the default value) by putting a "J" in that spot.  Furthermore, the user can combine many successive "J" entries by putting a digit before the J.  Therefore, to skip 4 entries, leaving all 4 with their default values, one would write "4J".

The PRDMP card takes 5 arguments, the 3rd of which is a flag for producing the MCTAL file.  If this third entry is non-zero, an MCTAL file will be produced.

So we'd need to be able to detect all the variations of a PRDMP card and in some cases need to insert the MCTAL entry into an otherwise compact set of J entries.

e.g.

    PRDMP 4J -1

	becomes

	    PRDMP J J 1 J -1

		The rest is left as an exercise for the reader...
